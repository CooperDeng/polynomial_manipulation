This is a MATLAB coding practice of mine. 

Files included are devleoped in collaboration with Anthony Xu, lab partner of mine in group39 of ECE240 F22, section 204.

I realized the action of evaluating, dividing and finding roots of a polynomial.

This is used only for MATLAB coding practice with no intention of profit.
